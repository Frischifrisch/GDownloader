GUI Wrapper for [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) written in Java

This program allows you to batch download YouTube videos and playlists with a simple CTRL+C.

It also supports other platforms such as Crunchyroll, Twitch, X/Twitter, and all other platforms supported by yt-dlp.

This program requires FFMPEG to be installed. If you're running Windows, it will attempt to download and set it up for you upon first boot.

The program automatically keeps yt-dlp updated and always ready to go.\
Multiple settings are available to best suit your usage style. Any feedback is welcome!
